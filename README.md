# USA-Electric-Vehicle-Population-Analysis-Power-BI-

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Power BI dashboard built on the Electric Vehicle Population dataset of the United States.
The dashboard analyzes electric vehicle registrations across counties and cities, focusing on vehicle type (BEV/PHEV), manufacturers, model year trends, electric range, and CAFV eligibility.

The purpose of this project is to understand EV adoption patterns, dominant manufacturers, geographic distribution, and technology trends in the U.S.

## 📊 Dashboard Analysis & Visuals

The Power BI dashboard includes analysis on:

## 🚗 Vehicle Distribution

Total number of electric vehicles

BEV vs PHEV comparison

Manufacturer-wise vehicle count

Model-wise vehicle distribution

##  Time-Based Analysis

Vehicle count by Model Year

Growth trend of EV adoption over years

## Geographic Insights

EV distribution by County and City

State-wise EV concentration

Vehicle density using location data

## Technology Insights

Electric range comparison across models

CAFV eligibility breakdown

Comparison of BEV and PHEV range characteristics

## Filters & Interactivity

The dashboard supports dynamic filtering using:

Vehicle Type (BEV / PHEV)

Make

Model Year

County

City

CAFV Eligibility

This allows detailed drill-down analysis at regional and manufacturer level.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard

Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) dominate the dataset compared to PHEVs

Tesla is the most represented manufacturer across multiple counties

EV adoption has increased significantly in recent model years (2019 onwards)

Urban counties show higher EV concentration

Vehicles with higher electric range are mostly BEVs
